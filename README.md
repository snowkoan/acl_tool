# acl_tool
Tool for playing with securable objects on Windows. This has been almost completley vibe coded with Claude Sonet and I'm pleasantly surprised at the results.

# Building

I'm building against VS2022 using cmake. I know Windows but I do not know CMake. Your mileage may vary when running build.bat

```cmake --version
cmake version 4.1.2
```
